The surf was running 2   – 3 feet with the  wind less than 5 knots. The water was 8 feet deep over a sandy ocean bottom  with like visibility as the bottom could be seen easily from the surface. No  marine mammals were observed in the area. Ellgen recalled;<em>\"I paddled out to the lineup at Oceano/Grover Beach alone.

I was about 20 yards outside  of where smaller waves were  consistently breaking waiting for set waves. While sitting on my board,  I looked into the water and saw the shark swim  about 4 feet away from me. It was  not between me and the shoreline and was underwater at a depth of about  4 feet below the surface. The White Shark swam  past and away from me and did not appear  interested in me at all.

I immediately  laid on my stomach on the board and gave a few paddles, making sure the shark wasn't heading back toward me or  directly under me. I made a couple more paddles until I could get pushed in by the surf a little more. A  bigger wave broke behind me, I  moved to the back of the board and belly-rode the wash in as far as I  could.

A witness, who was not identified, told Carpinteria Seal Watch volunteer  Curt Coughlin at about 9:30AM Wednesday  that he had just witnessed the  attacks. The person showed up out of breath at the observation point on the  bluff above the rookery and said, 'Your seal count will be two short today.' He  explained that he had just seen a great white leap out of the water near shore  with a seal in its mouth and that he had seen another seal attacked at the same  location the same morning. Mr. Coughlin checked the rookery and saw no signs of  the attacks. He went further east and  saw a harbor seal with a large bite out of its back.  He estimated the bite diameter at about 18  inches. A shark of that size would have  been approximately 14 to 16 feet long, either an immature great white or a  young adult. The seal was prone in the surf and Mr. Coughlin thought it was  still alive because its head was moving, but soon realized that it was just  being pushed by small waves. The News-Press received the report late that  afternoon. On Thursday, the beach was  examined from the rookery down to Rincon Point, over a mile east, but no signs  of any injured seals were seen. The park  host was informed and checked the area again Friday but saw nothing. On Friday, however, one, or possibly two,  shark-bitten, dead harbor seals washed ashore at Carpinteria State Beach,  according to lifeguards. Also, a  California sea lion came ashore with its intestines hanging out.  It went back out to sea but is not expected  to survive.  It may have also been a  victim of a shark attack. The beach was  surveyed Friday afternoon, but no animals, either living or dead, were found. An  oil industry worker mentioned that he had seen a small great white from the  Casitas Pier in Carpinteria in February and a 12 to 14-footer two weeks ago.\" </em>The SBMMC and the Shark Research Committee have  corroborated on   numerous shark/pinniped projects for more than 30 years.

The water was 8 feet deep with a sandy bottom and a recorded  temperature of 59 degrees. There were 3 –  4 foot swells with the surface water  calm beyond the surf line. The sky was partly cloudy with a temperature of 63  degrees and a slight bump on the water. I was sitting  on my board about 30 yards from shore waiting  for a wave. I had seen several dolphins earlier that morning, which was not  unusual. I suddenly notice a very large, at least 24 inches high, black  triangular fin surface 20 yards south of me. The shark came from the south  heading north in the surf line. The shark then descended with the fin going  completely underwater. I would estimate the distance from the dorsal fin to the  tail to be about 7 feet. I went ashore with a group of other surfers. Several  of them had chased down park and recreation lifeguards to report the incident.  I have been surfing this area for more than 15 years and have never seen  anything like this. I am extremely familiar with the abundance of the local  mammals and sharks but this one was very large and very close to shore. The size and shape of the dorsal fin, and  distance from it to the tail, suggests a White Shark as the species most likely  involved in this encounter. Caution should be exercised when utilizing this  location for your ocean water activities.\"</em> Please report any shark  sighting, encounter, or attack to the Shark Research Committee.  </p>\n",

      "i is <p><strong><font size=\"4\">Bolinas </font></strong>  — <strong><font size=\"4\">  </font></strong> On February 4, 2018 Caleb Arata was surfing about 100 feet from  shore at the Channel in Bolinas. It was 9:50 AM and he had been on the water  about 45 minutes. It was an incoming tide with a 1 – 2 foot swell and a light<em> ‘chop’  </em>to the sea surface. The sky was clear with an estimated air temperature of 56  degrees Fahrenheit. Some 10 – 20 minutes prior to seeing the shark in the channel,  I caught a wave and surfed all the way to the Stinson Beach side of the  channel, where I saw a seal in about ankle deep water. It was about 10 feet  away from me before it swam out into deeper water. Arata recalled; <em>“There were about 100 surfers and a single  kayaker in the Bolinas Channel, between Bolinas and Stinson Beach. I was  sitting inside to catch small waves, while the occasional 3 foot wave would  break 50 feet further out. There were 2 – 3 surfers further out, to catch the  occasional 3 foot wave. Looking out to sea I saw the dorsal fin of a shark  slowly pierce the top of the water. It was past where the larger waves would  break, I would estimate 75 feet from me and 25 feet from the surfer’s further  out. The fin and side of the shark were grey. It gently rolled sideways, and I  saw a glimpse of white from its belly. This was not a fast or violent movement.  The shark, now somewhat sideways, sank back under the water and was not seen  again. It is hard to estimate size beyond the fact that the shark was large. The  surfers I could see between me and the shark, 50 – 100 feet away, were on  longboards, 8 – 11 feet in length. Judging from the part of the shark visible,  I would estimate the total length of the shark to be greater than the length of  a longboard. At least two other people saw the shark. While I have never seen a  white shark in person, I do not know what else it could be. I am familiar with  the appearance of white sharks from photographs and documentaries.  We informed the sole kayaker of the sighting,  which he seemed to understand. He proceeded to paddle out to roughly where the  shark was seen, and last I saw he was by himself, catching waves. We cautiously  made our way to the beach.”</em> Please report any shark sighting, encounter, or  attack to the Shark Research Committee. </p>\n",
